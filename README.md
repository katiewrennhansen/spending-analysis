# Spend Analyzer App

## CreateSummary
The aim for this project is to create an application that will track monthly spending data and display insightful data visualizations based on all transactions made in a single month. The goal is not to store user transaction data, but instead to create regular monthly snapshots based on transaction data that will combine to create a detailed history of a users spending habits.
